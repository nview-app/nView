nView is a desktop application built with Electron — not a website.

The HTML files in this folder are part of the application and are not meant to be opened directly in a browser.

To install and use nView:

Option 1 (recommended):
Download and install the prebuilt Windows .exe from the GitHub Releases page:
https://github.com/nview-app/nView/releases

Option 2 (advanced):
Build and run the application from source using Node.js and Electron.
This option is intended for developers or users who want to customize or modify the application.

See README.md for full build and usage instructions.
