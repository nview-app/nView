# nView

nView is a Windows-focused Electron desktop app for collecting and reading comic/image-based downloads. It combines a built-in web viewer, direct download handling, a library gallery, and a reader into a single workflow with Vault-first, streaming encryption.

---

## Key functionality

- **Gallery library** with covers, metadata, and quick actions.
- **Reader** with page list navigation and in-app viewing.
- **Web Viewer** for browsing sites and triggering direct downloads.
- **Direct download** only (no torrent mode), pulling full-size images from thumbnails.
- **Downloader** window with progress and job controls for queued direct downloads.
- **Metadata editing** (title, artist, tags) and tag-based filtering.
- **Search + sorting** across title/artist/tags/ID and by recency, pages, or title.
- **Vault-only storage** with a required passphrase for encrypting library files at rest.
- **Streaming encryption** so downloads never write unencrypted files to disk.
- **Original file formats** retained (no image conversion).
- **Settings** for application URL, popup blocking, and dark mode.

## User manual

### First launch
1. Install and run the application.
2. Set a passphrase to encrypt your library.
3. **Gallery** window opens by default.
4. Open **settings** and set **Application URL**.
5. Use **Open Web Viewer** to browse and find content.

### Downloading content
#### Direct download (image galleries)
Some supported gallery pages expose a **Direct download** button in the Web Viewer.
1. Click **Direct download**.
2. nView pulls the full-size image URLs and downloads them directly.
3. Downloads are streamed through encryption and stored in original formats.

### Reading and managing the library
- Click a comic card to open the **Reader**.
- Use the page dropdown to jump to a specific page.
- Use **Edit** to update title/artist/tags or delete a comic.
- Use **Filter tags** to narrow results (match any vs. match all).
- Use the **Search** box to find by title, artist, tags, or ID.
- Use **Sort** to change ordering (recent, title, pages, oldest).

### Comic viewer
- Toggle "Favorites" with star icon.
- Jump to a selected page.
- Edit title, author and tags.
- Press **f** to switch view mode.
- Press **space** to jump to the next page.

### Settings
Open **Settings** from the Gallery toolbar:
- **Application URL**: default URL for Web Viewer and script hooks.
- **Block pop-ups**: deny new windows from the Web Viewer.
- **Dark mode**: apply dark theme across the app.

## Technical description

### Architecture
- **Main process** (`main.js`) owns windows, the download manager, settings persistence, vault operations, and a custom `appfile://` protocol for safe local image loading.
- **Renderer UI** (`windows/index.html` + `renderer/renderer.js`) provides the Gallery, Reader, tag filtering, search, and settings UI.
- **Preloads** (`preload/preload.js`, `preload/browser_preload.js`, `preload/browser_view_preload.js`, `preload/downloader_preload.js`) expose controlled IPC APIs and add page metadata hooks for alternate downloads.
- **Image pipeline** (`main/image_pipeline.js`) moves images into a flat, page-numbered layout.

### Project file overview
- `README.md`: Project overview, usage, and build instructions.
- `windows/browser.html`: Web Viewer window shell.
- `preload/browser_preload.js`: IPC bridge for the Web Viewer window.
- `renderer/browser_renderer.js`: UI glue for the Web Viewer window.
- `preload/browser_view_preload.js`: Injected helpers for metadata extraction and alternate downloads.
- `windows/downloader.html`: Downloader window shell.
- `preload/downloader_preload.js`: IPC bridge for the Downloader window.
- `renderer/downloader_renderer.js`: Downloader UI logic and job list rendering.
- `favicon.ico`: App favicon.
- `icon/`: App icon assets used by Electron/packaging.
- `main/image_pipeline.js`: Move pipeline for page images.
- `windows/index.html`: Main Gallery/Reader UI markup and styles.
- `logo/`: Brand/logo assets used in the README and app.
- `main.js`: Main process entry point, window management, download manager, library indexing, and IPC handlers.
- `package.json`: App metadata, scripts, and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Locked dependency tree for reproducible installs.
- `preload/preload.js`: IPC bridge for the main window (Gallery/Reader).
- `renderer/renderer.js`: Main window UI behavior, gallery rendering, reader, and settings interactions.
- `main/vault.js`: Vault encryption and key management.
- `node_modules/`: Installed dependencies (generated by `npm install`).

### Data storage
All data is stored under `app.getPath("userData")` (per-user):

```
Library/           # final, viewable comics
settings.json      # app settings
download_state.json
.library_index.json
```

Each comic lives in its own folder (ex: `Library/comic_<timestamp>_<id>/`) containing pages and `metadata.json.enc` (Vault-only).

### Download pipeline
1. Direct download requests queue the full-size image list.
2. Images stream through encryption during download (no plaintext writes).
3. Encrypted files are stored in a final `comic_*` folder (original formats).
4. Library index and metadata are updated.
5. The Gallery refreshes via IPC.

### Vault mode (encryption)
- Vault mode is mandatory and requires a passphrase.
- Uses **AES-256-GCM** with per-file keys derived via **HKDF** and a master key wrapped by **scrypt**.
- When configured, existing library files are encrypted and stored as `.enc` files.
- Downloads are encrypted on the fly using Vault-derived per-file keys.

### Windows SmartScreen / Antivirus warnings
This application is currently distributed as an unsigned Windows installer.
Because the installer is not code-signed with a commercial certificate, Windows SmartScreen and some antivirus products may display a warning during download or installation (for example: “Windows protected your PC”).
This is a common limitation for independent and open-source projects and **does not indicate malicious behavior**.

To verify the integrity of the installer:
- Each release includes the SHA-256 checksum of the attached .exe
- A corresponding VirusTotal scan is linked in the release notes
- You can independently hash the downloaded file and compare it to the published checksum

Alternatively, you may **build the application yourself from source** using the instructions in this repository.

If you are unsure, do not install the application.

Code signing may be added in a future release.
